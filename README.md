## Day 1

### Summary:
GPU is optimized for handling high performance task, unlike CPU, which focus on
sequential processing, GPUs have thousands of smaller cores designed for parallel excecution,
ideal for model training, simple computation intensive processing, graphics processing.

### Learned:
- GPUs computing
- why is it important for GPU in todays computation
- difference between CPU and GPU design
- why we need parallel computing
- learn basic CUDA with vector addition problem

### Reading:
- **Chapter 1 & 2** - PMPP.
